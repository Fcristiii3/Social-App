# Social-App

This is a Social App I've created, using NodeJS - MongoDB for backend and React for frontend

Each user can create an account, edit bio and upload profile pictures. They can see all the other users on the platform and follow them, and also can create a new post.

When entering the app, this is the homepage, filled with all the posts
