# Social-App

This is a Social App I've created, using NodeJS - MongoDB for [backend](https://github.com/Fcristiii3/Social-App/tree/main/nodeapi) and React for [frontend](https://github.com/Fcristiii3/Social-App/tree/main/react-front)

Each user can create an account, edit bio and upload profile pictures. They can see all the other users on the platform and follow them, and also can create a new post.

When entering the app, this is the homepage, filled with all the posts

  </div>
  
  Each user has their own profile, where they can edit credentials and bio, see their followers/ list of following and their posts
